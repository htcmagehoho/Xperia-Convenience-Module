## ‚ú® Why This Module? (Motivation)

Xperia devices, while powerful, sometimes come with regional limitations, particularly concerning Wi-Fi standards like Wi-Fi 6E and Wi-Fi 7. These advanced Wi-Fi technologies require specific radio certifications in each country. While many manufacturers may broadly include country codes regardless of official market launch, Sony's approach is more precise, often limiting these advanced features to officially launched regions.

This means that if you're in a region where the Xperia 1 VII is not officially launched, you might face restrictions or even inability to connect to Wi-Fi 7 networks, preventing you from enjoying its full benefits.

This module directly addresses this issue. We have meticulously added the necessary Wi-Fi 6E and Wi-Fi 7 country codes for **Korea (KR), China (CN), Russia (RU), United States (US), Canada (CA), and Australia (AU)** ‚Äì regions with a significant number of dedicated Xperia users but where the device might not be officially deployed for all bands.

If you are in a country not listed, you can easily modify the module yourself to include your specific region by inspecting its contents. We believe in maximizing the joy of using our beloved Xperia devices.
